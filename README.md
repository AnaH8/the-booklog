# The Booklog
Web app where you can keep track of read books

## Built with
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL db
- [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers)

## What I did
- set up a Node.js project using Express.js
- include EJS for templating
- persist data using a PostgreSQL database
- use CRUD methods to manipulate data in the database (add, edit, delete book)
- integrate a public API into the project
- create a frontend in HTML CSS JS
- sort books by title, newest or best

## How it looks
They all have a Cancel and Go Back button in the top left corner of the page (not shown in photos below)

## To be added in the future
- responsive design
- option to add notes 
- sign up/log in in order to be able to use CRUD methods books, otherwise just view them
- search books by title/author (using the API)
